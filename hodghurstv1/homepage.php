				<h1>Welcome to Hodghurst Farm </h1>
				<p>We are a family run business, who's aim is to supply you with free range, slowly grown food that has been born and raised on the farm. We keep rare breed pigs, chickens, <a href="#">sheep</a> and cattle. The animals graze in fields between the beautiful rolling South Shropshire Hills, on a predominantly grass based diet. Any supplementary feed is obtained locally and milled and mixed on farm, so we know that no growth promoters or antibiotics are in there. </p>
